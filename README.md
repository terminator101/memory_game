- You start by picking how many cards you want to play with
- Then you pick the theme
- Then you enter a player name and mark if its a computer or not

Afterwards you can add either more players or computers

- You click on two cards and if they match, you get to keep going and get a point
- If the cards don't match, you lose your turn
- The current players name is displayed on the top of the board
- The player with the highest score wins

## Computers
- The computers know only which cards have been previously flipped
- There is a 50% chance that a computer will make a mistake when opening a second card
